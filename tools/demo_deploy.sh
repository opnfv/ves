#. What this is: Complete scripted deployment of the VES monitoring framework.
#. Intended to be invoked from a server used to manage the nodes where the VES
#. framework is to be installed, referred to here as the "admin server". When
#. complete, the following will be installed:
#.  - On the specified master node, a Kafka server and containers running the
#.    VES "core components" (OPNFV Barometer VES agent, OPNFV VES collector,
#.    and optionally InfluxDB and Grafana if pre-existing instances of those
#.    components are not accessible at the default or provided hosts as
#.    described below).
#.    "master" as used here refers to the node where these common VES framework
#.    elements are deployed. It may typically be a master/control plane node
#.    for a set of nodes, but can also be any other node.
#.  - On each specified worker node, collectd configured per OPNFV Barometer
#.
#. Prerequisites:
#. - Ubuntu Xenial host for the admin server
#. - Ubuntu Xenial server for master and worker nodes
#. - Password-less ssh key provided for node setup
#. - hostname of selected master node in DNS or /etc/hosts
#. - env variables set prior to running this script, as per ves-setup.sh
#.     ves_kafka_hostname: hostname of the node where the kafka server runs
#. - optional env varibles set prior to running this script, as per ves-setup.sh
#.     ves_influxdb_host: ip:port of the influxdb service
#.     ves_influxdb_auth: authentication for the influxdb service
#.     ves_grafana_host: ip:port of the grafana service
#.     ves_grafana_auth: authentication for the grafana service
#.
#. For deployment in a kubernetes cluster as setup by OPNFV Models scripts:
#. - k8s cluster setup as in OPNFV Models repo tools/kubernetes/demo_deploy.sh
#.   which also allows use of Cloudify to deploy VES core services as
#.   k8s services.
#.
#. Usage: on the admin server
#. $ git clone https://gerrit.opnfv.org/gerrit/ves ~/ves
#. $ bash ~/ves/tools/demo_deploy.sh <key> <master> <workers> [cloudify]
#.   <key>: SSH key enabling password-less SSH to nodes
#.   <master>: master node where core components will be installed
#.   <workers>: list of worker nodes where collectd will be installed
#.   cloudify: flag indicating to deploy VES core services via Cloudify
